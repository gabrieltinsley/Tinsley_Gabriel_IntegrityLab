# Integrity Models Lab README
# Author: Gabriel Tinsley
# Date: 2/22/2025

## Overview
This submission includes implementations of the Biba Model, Low-Water-Mark Policy, and Ring Policy.
Each lab is structured with Python scripts and test results demonstrating the effectiveness of each model.

## Running the Code
1. Install Python 3.
2. Navigate to each lab directory and run `python <script_name>.py`
3. For Lab 4, execute `bash integrity_prevention.sh`

## Assumptions
- The integrity levels are predefined.
- The system assumes all initial integrity levels are correct.

## Limitations
- The simulation does not integrate with real file systems dynamically.
